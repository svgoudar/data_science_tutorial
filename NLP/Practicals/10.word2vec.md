Word2Vec is a deep learning-based word embedding technique that transforms words into numerical vectors, preserving semantic and syntactic relationships. Let's summarize and explain the key concepts:

### Overview of Word2Vec

1. **Purpose**: Convert words into dense numerical vectors (embeddings) such that similar words are close in vector space, while dissimilar words are far apart. This enables models to understand and process relationships between words in meaningful ways.

2. **Key Idea**: Words with similar contexts in large text corpora tend to have similar meanings. For instance, "king" and "queen" are semantically related and their vector representations will reflect this.

---

### Features of Word2Vec

1. **Semantic Meaning**:
   - Captures word relationships like synonyms or opposites.
   - Words like "king" and "queen" will be closer in vector space, while "king" and "apple" will be far apart.

2. **Feature Representation**:
   - Each word is represented as a high-dimensional vector (e.g., 300-dimensional).
   - These dimensions encode features such as gender, royalty, age, or other latent features inferred from data.

3. **Contextual Representation**:
   - Words derive meaning from the context they appear in. Word2Vec captures this by analyzing surrounding words in sentences or paragraphs.

---

### Word2Vec Models

1. **Skip-gram Model**:
   - Predicts the context (surrounding words) given a target word.
   - Example: Given "king", predict words like "royalty", "queen", or "crown".

2. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**:
   - Predicts the target word based on its context (surrounding words).
   - Example: Given "The __ is on the throne", predict "king".

---

### Training Word2Vec

1. **Input Data**:
   - Large text corpora are required (e.g., books, news articles, or Wikipedia).
   - Words are processed to remove stop words and punctuation, and converted into tokens.

2. **Neural Network**:
   - A shallow neural network is used with one hidden layer.
   - The output is a dense word embedding for each word in the vocabulary.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Uses techniques like Negative Sampling or Hierarchical Softmax to efficiently train on massive datasets.

---

### Benefits Over Traditional Methods

1. **Dense Vectors**:
   - Unlike Bag of Words or TF-IDF, which produce sparse vectors, Word2Vec generates dense, meaningful vectors.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Handles large vocabularies and datasets efficiently.

3. **Captures Relationships**:
   - Semantic relationships are encoded mathematically (e.g., vector for "king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ vector for "queen").

---

### Applications of Word2Vec

1. **Text Similarity**:
   - Find similar words, phrases, or documents by comparing vector distances.

2. **Synonym Detection**:
   - Identify words with similar meanings based on proximity in vector space.

3. **Machine Translation**:
   - Map words across languages using vector alignments.

4. **Autocomplete and Recommendations**:
   - Suggest contextually relevant words or phrases.

### Word2Vec Overview

Word2Vec is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) for creating dense, distributed vector representations of words. These representations capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words. Word2Vec has two primary models:

1. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):** Predicts the center word based on its context (surrounding words).
2. **Skip-Gram:** Predicts context words given a center word.

In this discussion, we focus on the CBOW model.

---

### Steps in CBOW Training

#### 1. **Corpus Preparation**

A corpus is the dataset or text used to train the Word2Vec model. It may consist of sentences, paragraphs, or larger documents. For example:

- Example corpus: `"I neuron company is related to data science."`

#### 2. **Window Size**

- The window size defines the number of context words (both before and after the center word) used to predict the target word.
- For example, with a window size of 5:
  - Input: `I neuron company related to`
  - Center word (output): `is`

#### 3. **Input-Output Pairs**

Using the window size, the data is split into input (context words) and output (center word). This process slides over the text, creating multiple training samples.

#### Example

Corpus: `"I neuron company is related to data science"`

- Input 1: `[I, neuron, company, related, to]` → Output: `is`
- Input 2: `[neuron, company, is, to, data]` → Output: `related`

#### 4. **Word Representation**

To feed words into a neural network, they must be represented numerically. A common method is **one-hot encoding**, where:

- Each word in the vocabulary is represented as a vector with one "1" and the rest "0".
- For a vocabulary of size 7:
  - `"I"` → `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `"company"` → `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

---

### CBOW Neural Network Architecture

1. **Input Layer:**
   - Takes one-hot encoded vectors of context words.

2. **Hidden Layer:**
   - A fully connected layer with dimensionality smaller than the vocabulary size.
   - Learns dense vector representations (embeddings) for each word.

3. **Output Layer:**
   - Predicts the center word using a probability distribution over the vocabulary.
   - Softmax activation ensures probabilities sum to 1.

---

### Training the Model

1. **Loss Function:**
   - The model uses a loss function like **cross-entropy** to measure the difference between predicted probabilities and the actual target word.

2. **Optimization:**
   - The weights of the network (word embeddings) are updated using optimizers like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**.

---

### Pre-trained Word2Vec Models

- Models like Google’s Word2Vec, trained on billions of words, can be used for various NLP tasks without training from scratch.
- Pre-trained models save computational resources and time.

---

### Applications of Word2Vec

1. **Semantic Analysis:** Identifying similar or related words.
2. **Text Classification:** Representing text as word embeddings for machine learning models.
3. **Recommendation Systems:** Analyzing textual metadata for better recommendations.
4. **Machine Translation:** Aligning word representations across languages.

**Natural Language Processing: Skip-gram Architecture Overview**

Hello everyone! Today, we will continue our discussion on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, focusing on the **Skip-gram architecture**, which is a key concept in **word embeddings**. In our previous session, we explored **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**. Let’s now dive into Skip-gram, understand its architecture, and compare it with CBOW.

---

### **1. Understanding Skip-gram**

The Skip-gram model is used to create word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic and syntactic meanings. Unlike CBOW, where we predict the target word using context words, Skip-gram reverses this approach:

- **Input:** A single word (center word).
- **Output:** Context words (words surrounding the center word).

---

### **2. Key Differences Between CBOW and Skip-gram**

| Feature            | CBOW                         | Skip-gram                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Objective**       | Predict the center word from context words. | Predict context words from the center word. |
| **Data Requirements** | Performs well on small datasets.          | Better for large datasets.                |
| **Training Time**   | Faster training.             | Slower but often more accurate.           |
| **Performance**     | Smoother, generalized embeddings. | Captures rare words better.               |

### **3. How Skip-gram Works**

Let’s break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Input Representation**:  
   - A single word is represented as a **one-hot encoded vector** of the vocabulary size. For example, in a vocabulary of 7 words, the vector for the word "is" might look like this: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

2. **Window Size**:  
   - The window size defines the number of context words to consider around the input word. For example, if the window size is 2, the model will predict two words before and after the center word.

3. **Hidden Layer (Embedding Layer)**:  
   - A weight matrix is initialized randomly with dimensions **vocabulary size × embedding size** (e.g., 7×5). This layer transforms the one-hot encoded input into a dense vector (word embedding).

4. **Output Layer**:  
   - A second weight matrix connects the embedding layer to the output. The output is a softmax layer that predicts the probability of each word in the vocabulary being a context word.

5. **Training**:  
   - The model uses **forward propagation** to predict the probabilities of context words.
   - A **loss function** (e.g., cross-entropy) computes the error between the predicted probabilities and the actual context words.
   - **Backward propagation** updates the weights to minimize the loss.

### **4. Implementation Insights**

- **Input-Output Mapping**:  
  - For the sentence: *"I neuron company is related to data science"*, and a window size of 2:  
    - Input: "neuron", Outputs: ["I", "company"].  
    - Input: "company", Outputs: ["neuron", "is"].

- **Weight Matrices**:  
  - Two matrices are trained:
    1. **Input-to-hidden**: Captures word embeddings.
    2. **Hidden-to-output**: Maps embeddings to context words.

---

### **5. When to Use CBOW vs. Skip-gram**

- Use **CBOW** for **smaller datasets** or when you prioritize **training speed**.
- Use **Skip-gram** for **larger datasets** or to capture subtle relationships, especially for **rare words**.

---

### **6. Improving Word2Vec Models**

1. **Increase Training Data**:  
   - Larger datasets improve the quality of embeddings.
2. **Increase Window Size**:  
   - A larger window captures broader contextual information, leading to richer embeddings.
3. **Use Pre-trained Models**:  
   - Leverage pre-trained embeddings like **Google’s Word2Vec** trained on 3 billion words from Google News, offering 300-dimensional vectors for words.

---

### **7. Practical Applications**

- **Semantic Analysis**: Understand relationships between words.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Capture context to identify emotions in text.
- **Machine Translation**: Improve translation accuracy by understanding word embeddings.
