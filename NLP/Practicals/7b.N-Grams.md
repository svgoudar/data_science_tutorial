### Introduction to N-grams in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Overview**:  
N-grams are a foundational concept in natural language processing (NLP), widely used for feature extraction and text analysis. They involve breaking down a sentence into contiguous sequences of words or characters, capturing the context and structure of text data. This is particularly useful in tasks like sentiment analysis, language modeling, and text classification.

### **What are N-grams?**

An N-gram is a continuous sequence of `n` items (words, characters, or tokens) from a given text.  

- **Unigram**: Single words (n=1)  
- **Bigram**: Pairs of consecutive words (n=2)  
- **Trigram**: Groups of three consecutive words (n=3)  

For example, in the sentence `"The food is good"`:  

- **Unigrams**: `["The", "food", "is", "good"]`  
- **Bigrams**: `["The food", "food is", "is good"]`  
- **Trigrams**: `["The food is", "food is good"]`

### **Why Use N-grams?**

1. **Contextual Understanding**:  
   N-grams capture relationships between words, providing better context compared to individual words (unigrams).  
   Example: The bigram `"not good"` conveys a negative sentiment, distinguishing it from `"good"`.

2. **Addressing Ambiguity**:  
   Single-word features often fail to differentiate sentences with opposite meanings. N-grams consider word combinations to provide better differentiation.

3. **Improving Text Representation**:  
   When using methods like Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), N-grams enrich the feature space by including word combinations, leading to more informative vector representations.

### **How N-grams Solve Ambiguity**

Consider two sentences:  

1. `"Food is good"`  
2. `"Food is not good"`

Using a unigram-based representation:  

- Vocabulary: `["food", "good", "not"]`  
- Sentence 1: `[1, 1, 0]`  
- Sentence 2: `[1, 1, 1]`  

These vectors are similar despite the sentences conveying opposite meanings.

Using bigrams:  

- Vocabulary: `["food good", "food not", "not good"]`  
- Sentence 1: `[1, 0, 0]`  
- Sentence 2: `[0, 1, 1]`  

The vectors now clearly distinguish the sentences.

### **Implementation in NLP Models**

Most machine learning frameworks (e.g., Scikit-learn) support N-grams through parameters like `ngram_range` in feature extraction methods.  

- **`ngram_range=(1, 1)`**: Unigrams only  
- **`ngram_range=(1, 2)`**: Unigrams and bigrams  
- **`ngram_range=(2, 3)`**: Bigrams and trigrams

### **Advantages and Limitations**

**Advantages**:  

- Captures context and relationships between words.  
- Enhances feature richness, aiding in tasks like sentiment analysis.  
- Simple and intuitive to implement.  

**Limitations**:  

- Larger N-grams increase dimensionality, requiring more memory and computational power.  
- May still lack deep semantic understanding, which advanced models (e.g., transformers) address.
