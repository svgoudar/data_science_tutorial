In this video, we are diving into some foundational concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that are essential for understanding how text data is processed and analyzed. These terms will be revisited frequently throughout our discussions, so it’s crucial to grasp them now.

### 1. **Corpus**  

A corpus is a collection of text, which can be a set of paragraphs, documents, or any other body of written content. For example, when you gather a set of news articles or a book, that entire collection is called a corpus. In the NLP context, it refers to any collection of text that we analyze or process.

### 2. **Documents**  

In NLP, a document typically refers to a sentence or a piece of text that makes up part of a larger corpus. For example, the sentence “My name is Krish” can be considered a document. When analyzing text data, breaking it down into manageable pieces, or documents, makes it easier to process and extract meaning.

### 3. **Vocabulary**  

Vocabulary refers to the collection of unique words found within a corpus. In simpler terms, it’s the set of distinct words in a body of text. For example, in a dictionary, the list of words is your vocabulary. In NLP, understanding the vocabulary helps in tasks like language modeling and text classification.

### 4. **Words**  

Words are the basic building blocks of any corpus or document. They are the individual terms present in the text, and processing them helps in converting raw text into a format suitable for analysis. Words can be tokenized into smaller components, which we’ll discuss next.

### 5. **Tokenization**  

Tokenization is one of the first steps in NLP text preprocessing. It refers to breaking down a corpus into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be sentences or words, depending on the level of tokenization.

- **Sentence Tokenization**: When you split a paragraph or a body of text into individual sentences, that process is called sentence tokenization. For example, if you have the paragraph “My name is Krish. I love teaching,” applying sentence tokenization would result in two sentences:
     1. “My name is Krish.”
     2. “I love teaching.”

- **Word Tokenization**: After sentence tokenization, you can further break down the sentences into individual words. For instance, “My name is Krish” would be tokenized into:
     1. “My”
     2. “name”
     3. “is”
     4. “Krish”

Understanding tokenization is important because many NLP techniques require text to be in a tokenized format. For example, converting words into vectors for machine learning models starts with tokenization.

### Practical Example  

Let’s take the paragraph:  
“I like to drink apple juice. My friend likes mango juice.”

- **Tokenization (sentences)**:  
  - Sentence 1: “I like to drink apple juice.”
  - Sentence 2: “My friend likes mango juice.”

- **Tokenization (words)**:  
  - Word tokens: [“I”, “like”, “to”, “drink”, “apple”, “juice”, “My”, “friend”, “likes”, “mango”, “juice”]

From this, we can count:

- **Total words**: 11  
- **Unique words (Vocabulary)**: 10  
  - Note that repeated words like “juice” are counted only once in the vocabulary.

This distinction is important because understanding both the total number of words and the unique words (vocabulary) in a corpus helps in text processing tasks like text classification, topic modeling, or information retrieval.

### Why Tokenization Matters

Tokenization is a critical part of text preprocessing in NLP. Each word or sentence token becomes the basis for further analysis, such as:

- Converting words into numerical representations (like word embeddings).
- Understanding the frequency of words for tasks like word cloud generation.
- Enabling text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.

### Summary of Key Points

- **Corpus**: A collection of text data.
- **Documents**: Sentences or pieces of text within the corpus.
- **Vocabulary**: The unique words found in a corpus.
- **Tokenization**: The process of converting text into smaller units (sentences or words).

In the next video, we will explore how to implement tokenization in Python using the NLTK library, making these concepts more tangible. Stay tuned for that practical demonstration!
