# Welcome to the Statistics Module

Hello everyone, welcome to this amazing statistics module! In this video, we will discuss two important topics:

1. **What is statistics?**
2. **The application of statistics in the Data Analytics industry**, specifically focusing on the roles of a **Data Scientist** and a **Data Analyst**.

## What is Statistics?

Statistics is one of the most important subjects in the field of data analytics. Whether you're working as a **data scientist** or **data analyst**, statistics is integral to tasks like:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Feature Selection**

Wherever data is involved, statistics is used to make **informed decisions**.

### Definition of Statistics

Statistics is the **science of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data**. These are the key activities involved:

- **Collecting**: Gathering data from various sources.
- **Organizing**: Cleaning and structuring the data through feature engineering and formatting.
- **Analyzing**: Extracting insights from data to support decision-making.

Ultimately, the goal of statistics in data science or analytics is **decision making**.

---

## What is Data?

**Data** is defined as **facts or pieces of information** that can be measured, collected, and analyzed. 

### Examples of Data:

1. **Weights of students in a class**  
   - Example: 60kg, 50kg, 45kg, etc.

2. **IQ of students in a class**  
   - Example: 100, 95, 90, 99, etc.

Whatever analysis we want to perform on this data can be done using **statistics**.

## Example: House Price Dataset

Consider a **house price dataset** with the following features:

- **Area of the house** (e.g., 1000ft², 1250ft²)
- **Number of rooms** (e.g., 2 rooms, 2.5 rooms)
- **Price of the house** (e.g., 45 lakhs, 50 lakhs)
- **City** (e.g., Bangalore, New York, Mumbai)

### Data Scientist

A data scientist may use this data to build a **machine learning model** that predicts house prices based on features like **city**, **area**, and **number of rooms**.

### Data Analyst

A data analyst might create **reports or visualizations** that present trends based on cities, helping stakeholders make decisions like **where to start a new project**.

## Applications of Statistics in Data Science and Analytics

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Helps in understanding and summarizing the data.

2. **Model Building and Validation**  
   - Critical for building machine learning models.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Used to analyze sample data and make conclusions about the population data.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Involves testing assumptions using **null** and **alternate hypotheses**.

5. **Optimization and Efficiency**  
   - Enhances the performance of models and reporting tools.

### Reporting

Statistics also helps in **report creation** for **data analysts**, allowing them to deliver insights that drive business decisions.

## Conclusion

Whether you're aiming to become a **data scientist** or **data analyst**, a strong understanding of statistics is a must. Being proficient in statistics helps you **handle and interpret data** effectively, no matter the complexity of the problem.

### Coming Up Next

In the next video, we will explore the **types of statistics**.

Thank you for watching!

Hello guys, and welcome back!

In this video, we are going to continue our discussion on **statistics**, and specifically focus on two main types of statistics: **descriptive statistics** and **inferential statistics**. These are essential concepts in understanding data, especially in fields like **data science** and **data analytics**.

---

### **Descriptive Statistics**

Let’s start with **descriptive statistics**. So, what is descriptive statistics? In simple terms, **descriptive statistics** involves methods for **summarizing** and **organizing data** to make it understandable. The goal is to describe the **basic features** of the data in a study.

Key terms to remember here are **summarizing** and **organizing**. These terms highlight what descriptive statistics help us achieve. It’s all about **understanding** your data, but we’ll discuss examples to make this clearer.

---

#### **Concepts in Descriptive Statistics**

**1. Measure of Central Tendency**

This is one of the most important concepts in descriptive statistics. Under this, we’ll learn about:

- **Mean**
- **Median**
- **Mode**

Why are these concepts important? Because they help in organizing and understanding data. For example, if you have a dataset, calculating the mean or median can help you understand where the center of your data lies.

**2. Measure of Dispersion**

Next up is **measure of dispersion**, which covers two critical topics:

- **Variance**
- **Standard Deviation**

These metrics help you understand the **spread** of your data—whether it’s tightly clustered or spread out.

**3. Data Distribution**

Data distribution refers to how data is spread across different values, and here we’ll discuss:

- **Histograms**
- **Box Plots**
- **Pie Charts**

We will also touch upon important concepts like **Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)** and **Probability Mass Functions (PMFs)**.

**4. Summary Statistics**

Finally, we’ll cover **summary statistics**, which include topics like:

- **Five Number Summary** (Q1, Q2/Median, Q3, Min, and Max)

Summary statistics help to quickly describe the **shape, spread, and center** of your data.

### **Inferential Statistics**

Now, moving on to **inferential statistics**. This branch of statistics involves methods for making **predictions** or **inferences** about a population based on **sample data**. Essentially, you’re taking a smaller dataset, or **sample**, and making conclusions about a larger **population**.

---

#### **Concepts in Inferential Statistics**

**1. Hypothesis Testing**

A key concept in inferential statistics is **hypothesis testing**, where we’ll learn about:

- **Null Hypothesis**
- **Alternate Hypothesis**
- **P-Values**

**2. Confidence Intervals**

We’ll also learn how to calculate **confidence intervals**, which give a range of values that are likely to contain the true population parameter.

**3. Statistical Tests**

Inferential statistics also include various statistical tests like:

- **Z-Test**
- **T-Test**
- **ANOVA**
- **Chi-Square Test**
- **F-Test**

These tests help in making inferences from sample data to larger populations.

---

### **Example**

Let’s make this more concrete with an example.

#### **Descriptive Statistics Question:**

You have collected the **heights** of 20 students in a statistics class, and you have the following data:

- 175 cm, 180 cm, 140 cm, 135 cm, 160 cm, 120 cm...

A **descriptive statistics** question here could be: **What is the average height of the entire classroom?** Here, you’re trying to calculate the **mean**, which is a **measure of central tendency**.

#### **Inferential Statistics Question:**

Now, let’s say you want to know: **Are the heights of students in this classroom similar to what you expect across the entire college?** This is an **inferential statistics** question because you’re using data from a smaller sample (your class) to make conclusions about a larger population (the college).

---

### **Final Summary**

In this video, we covered two types of statistics:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Where we learn about **measures of central tendency**, **dispersion**, and other methods for summarizing and organizing data.
  
- **Inferential Statistics**: Where we use sample data to make **predictions** and **inferences** about a larger population, with techniques like **hypothesis testing** and **confidence intervals**.

In the next video, we will dive into the concepts of **population** and **sample data**, and how they form the basis for inferential statistics. Stay tuned for that!

Thank you for watching, and see you in the next video!
