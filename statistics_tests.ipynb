    "The **p-test**, **z-test**, **t-test**, **chi-square test**, and **F-test** are all statistical tests used to determine the significance of hypotheses in different situations. Let’s go over each of them, their uses, and provide examples in Python along with in-depth explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **p-Test**\n",
    "A **p-test** is not a standalone test but refers to the **p-value** that comes out of any statistical test (e.g., z-test, t-test, etc.). The **p-value** tells you the probability of observing your data if the null hypothesis is true. A p-value below a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) indicates that the results are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **z-Test**\n",
    "A **z-test** is used when:\n",
    "- The population variance is known.\n",
    "- The sample size is large (n > 30).\n",
    "- The data is normally distributed or nearly normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **z-test** compares the sample mean to the population mean to see if they differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of a z-Test in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ztest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "sample_data = [2.3, 2.5, 3.1, 2.8, 2.9, 2.4, 2.7, 2.8]\n",
    "population_mean = 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform z-test\n",
    "z_stat, p_value = ztest(sample_data, value=population_mean)\n",
    "print(f\"Z-statistic: {z_stat}, P-value: {p_value}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis**: The sample mean equals the population mean.\n",
    "- **Alternate Hypothesis**: The sample mean is different from the population mean.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 3. **t-Test**\n",
    "A **t-test** is used when:\n",
    "- The population variance is unknown.\n",
    "- The sample size is small (n < 30).\n",
    "- You are testing for significant differences between the sample and population mean or between two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of t-tests:\n",
    "- **One-sample t-test**: Tests whether the mean of a single sample differs from a known population mean.\n",
    "- **Two-sample t-test (Independent t-test)**: Compares the means of two independent samples.\n",
    "- **Paired t-test**: Compares means of two related samples (e.g., before and after treatment).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of a One-Sample t-Test in Python:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "sample1 = [2.3, 2.5, 3.1, 2.8, 2.9]\n",

    "### 4. **Chi-Square (χ²) Test**\n",
    "The **chi-square test** is used for categorical data to test the association between two variables or to test if a distribution follows a specific expected distribution. It’s useful for testing independence in contingency tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of chi-square tests:\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Test for Independence**: Tests whether two categorical variables are independent.\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test**: Tests if the observed frequency distribution matches the expected distribution.\n",

    "- **Alternate Hypothesis**: The variables are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **F-Test**\n",
    "The **F-test** is used to compare the variances of two or more groups. It is often used in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to test whether there are significant differences between group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-way ANOVA**: Tests differences between the means of three or more groups.\n",
    "- **Two-way ANOVA**: Tests for differences between means based on two factors.\n",
