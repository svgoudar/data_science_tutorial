### Script Summary: Support Vector Regression (SVR) in Machine Learning

---

### **Introduction**

- Welcome back! In this video, weâ€™ll discuss **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.
- Previously, we covered **Support Vector Classification (SVC)**, its cost function, constraints, and the hinge loss.
- Weâ€™ll now focus on how SVR handles **regression problems** and adapts concepts like cost functions and constraints.

---

### **Regression Problem Overview**

- Regression predicts a **continuous target variable**.
- Example: Predicting the **price of a house** based on its **size**.
- Unlike classification, SVR aims to:
  - Find a **best-fit line**.
  - Create **marginal planes** around this line.
  - Ensure most data points fall within the margin.

---

### **Key Concepts in SVR**

1. **Cost Function**:
   - SVR minimizes $\frac{1}{2} ||w||^2$ while introducing **constraints**.
   - Constraints ensure the model generalizes well and minimizes the error.

2. **Best-Fit Line and Margins**:
   - The line is represented as $w^T x + b$.
   - Marginal planes are defined as:
     -$w^T x + b + \epsilon$(upper margin).
     -$w^T x + b - \epsilon$(lower margin).
   - **Epsilon ($\epsilon$)**: Represents the **margin of tolerance** for errors.

3. **Key Constraints**:
   - The absolute difference between the true value ($y_i$) and the predicted value ($w^T x + b$) should be:
    $
     |y_i - (w^T x + b)| \leq \epsilon
    $
   - This ensures most points fall within the marginal planes.

### **Handling Outliers**

- Some points may fall **outside the margin**.
- To account for these, we introduce:
  - **Slack variables ($\eta_i$)**: Measure deviation from the margin.
  - Updated constraints:
   $
    |y_i - (w^T x + b)| \leq \epsilon + \eta_i
   $

---

### **Modified Cost Function**

- The updated cost function incorporates both$\epsilon$and$\eta_i$:
 $
  \text{Minimize: } \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \eta_i
 $
  -$C$: A **hyperparameter** that controls the trade-off between minimizing slack variables and maintaining a flat margin.
  -$\eta_i$: Penalizes points outside the margin, ensuring they are accounted for in optimization.

---

### **Hyperparameters in SVR**

1. **Epsilon ($\epsilon$)**:
   - Controls the marginâ€™s width.
   - Larger$\epsilon$: Allows more tolerance for errors within the margin.
   - Smaller$\epsilon$: Tighter fit to the data.

2. **C (Regularization Parameter)**:
   - Balances the trade-off between **minimizing margin width** and **tolerating errors**.
   - Higher$C$: Less tolerance for points outside the margin.
   - Lower$C$: More tolerance for deviations.

---

### **Key Observations**

- Relationship between$C$and loss:
  - As$C$increases, the loss decreases.
  - Loss function plot:$C$on the x-axis, loss on the y-axis (assignment to explore).

---

### **Conclusion**

- SVR introduces parameters like$\epsilon$and$\eta_i$to handle regression effectively.
- It ensures a balance between:
  - **Minimizing errors within the margin.**
  - **Handling outliers outside the margin.**
- Practical examples and implementation will be covered in the next video.
