### **AdaBoost - Normalized Weights and Bin Assignment**

#### **1. Importance of Weight Updates**

- **Purpose of Weight Updates:**
  - Weights are updated after each decision tree stump to focus on incorrectly classified data points.
  - Incorrect classifications receive increased weights, ensuring they are emphasized in the next stump.

#### **2. Normalizing Weights**

- **Why Normalize?**
  - After updating weights, the total weight sum may not equal 1 (e.g., summation = 0.697).
  - Normalization ensures that the total weight sum equals 1, which is essential for proper weight distribution.
  
- **Normalization Process:**
  - Divide each weight by the total sum of weights (e.g., $0.697$).
  - For instance:
    - $\text{New Weight} = \frac{\text{Weight}}{\text{Total Sum}}$
    - Example: $0.058 / 0.697 \approx 0.08$.
  - After normalizing, the sum of all weights equals 1.

#### **3. Assigning Bins**

- **Purpose of Bin Assignment:**
  - Bins help identify which data points should be passed to the next decision tree stump, with a focus on incorrectly classified points.
  
- **Bin Range Construction:**
  - Construct bins based on cumulative normalized weights.
  - Example:
    - First bin: $[0, 0.08]$
    - Second bin: $(0.08, 0.16]$
    - Third bin: $(0.16, 0.24]$, and so on.
  - The final bin range covers the entire normalized weight range, ensuring all data points are included.

#### **4. Targeting Incorrectly Classified Records**

- **Why Emphasize Incorrect Points?**
  - Incorrectly classified records often have larger normalized weights.
  - These points are prioritized for the next stump, ensuring better classification in subsequent iterations.
  
- **Mechanism:**
  - Use bins to frequently sample and emphasize these incorrect points for the next decision tree stump.
  - This approach ensures that the model progressively improves its focus on hard-to-classify data.

#### **5. Preparing Data for the Next Decision Tree Stump**

- After bin assignment, the next step involves:
  - Selecting records based on their bins.
  - Preparing the dataset for the next stump.
  
- This process includes:
  - **Steps:** Weight updates → Normalization → Bin assignment → Data preparation.
  - Repeating these steps ensures that the AdaBoost algorithm iteratively builds better weak learners.
