Here's a transcript breakdown and summary of the third step of constructing an AdaBoost classifier, focusing on updating weights for correctly and incorrectly classified points.

### **Summary of Step 3: Updating Weights**

The **key objective** of this step is to adjust the weights of data points to prioritize misclassified points, ensuring that the next weak learner (decision stump) focuses more on them.

---

#### **Why Update Weights?**

- **Correctly Classified Points**: Decrease their weights to reduce their influence on the next stump.
- **Incorrectly Classified Points**: Increase their weights to ensure they are prioritized in the next stump's training.

This re-weighting is critical for AdaBoost, as it dynamically shifts focus to harder-to-classify points.

#### **Formulas for Weight Updates**

1. **Correctly Classified Points**:  
   $
   \text{Updated Weight} = \text{Old Weight} \times e^{-\text{Performance of Stump}}
   $
   Where:
   - Old Weight = $\frac{1}{n}$ (equal initial weight for $n$ points).
   - Performance of Stump = Measure of how well the stump performed, calculated in Step 2.

   Example Computation:
   - Old Weight = $\frac{1}{7}$ (for 7 points in the dataset).
   - Performance of Stump = $0.896$.
   $
   \text{Updated Weight} = \frac{1}{7} \times e^{-0.896} \approx 0.058
   $

   The updated weight for all correctly classified points becomes $0.058$.

2. **Incorrectly Classified Points**:  
   $
   \text{Updated Weight} = \text{Old Weight} \times e^{\text{Performance of Stump}}
   $
   Example Computation:
   - Old Weight = $\frac{1}{7}$.
   - Performance of Stump = $0.896$.
   $
   \text{Updated Weight} = \frac{1}{7} \times e^{0.896} \approx 0.349
   $

   The updated weight for the incorrectly classified point becomes $0.349$.

---

#### **Result of Weight Updates**

- Correctly classified points now have lower weights ($0.058$).
- Incorrectly classified points now have higher weights ($0.349$).

This ensures a **higher probability of selecting misclassified points** for the next decision stump.

### **Next Step: Normalizing Weights**

In Step 4, you will compute normalized weights to ensure that the sum of all weights equals 1. This normalization step maintains the probabilistic framework necessary for sampling in AdaBoost.
