# KNN

## **Overview of KNN**

- **Definition**: KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm used for solving both classification and regression problems.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Instance-based learning (lazy learning): KNN does not build a model during training.
  - It uses a predefined number of neighbors (**k**) to classify or predict a data point based on its proximity to others.

## **Steps for KNN in Classification**

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Dataset with features (e.g.,$F_1, F_2$) and a target (e.g.,$y$).  
   - Target can be binary $(0, 1)$ or multi-class.  

2. **Initialize $k$**:
   -$k$ is the number of neighbors to consider. It is a **hyperparameter** that impacts model performance.  

3. **Compute Distance**:
   - Measure the distance between the new (test) data point and all points in the training dataset.
   - Common distance metrics:
     - **Euclidean Distance**: Measures straight-line distance.
      $
       d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
      $
     - **Manhattan Distance**: Sum of absolute differences along each dimension.
      $
       d = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|
      $
   - Choose the metric based on the problem's context.  

4. **Select $k$-Nearest Neighbors**:
   - Identify the $k$ closest data points to the test point using the chosen distance metric.  

5. **Classify the Test Point**:
   - Count the labels of the $k$ -nearest neighbors.
   - Assign the most common label among the neighbors to the test point.

### **Transition to Regression**

The regression version of KNN works similarly, except:  

- Instead of classification based on the majority class, the algorithm computes the **average (or weighted average)** of the target values from the $k$-nearest neighbors.  
- **Steps**:
  1. Select $k$-nearest neighbors.
  2. Compute the average of their target values.  
  3. Assign this average as the prediction for the test point.  

For example:

- Given data points with $y$-values as targets, if $k = 3$, and the target values of the nearest neighbors are $2.5, 3.0$ and $3.5$, then:
  
$
  \text{Prediction} = \frac{2.5 + 3.0 + 3.5}{3} = 3.0
$

### **Important Considerations**

1. **Choosing $k$**:
   - Small $k$: Can lead to noisy predictions (overfitting).
   - Large $k$: Can oversmooth results (underfitting).
   - Optimal $k$ is determined via **cross-validation**.  

2. **Scaling Features**:
   - Normalize or standardize features to ensure fair distance computation (e.g., using Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling).  

3. **Distance Metric Selection**:
   - Use domain knowledge or experimentation to decide between Euclidean, Manhattan, or other metrics.
