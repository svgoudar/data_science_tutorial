This script provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the Gradient Boosting Machine Learning algorithm. Here's a structured breakdown of the process:

### Key Points in the Script

1. **Introduction to Gradient Boosting:**
   - A boosting ensemble technique where decision trees are created sequentially.
   - Weak learners (e.g., small decision trees) are combined to form a strong learner.
   - Applicable for both regression and classification tasks.

2. **Dataset Overview:**
   - Features: `Experience` and `Degree` (independent variables).
   - Target: `Salary` (dependent variable).
   - Regression problem with continuous output.

3. **Steps of Gradient Boosting:**
   - **Step 1: Create a Base Model**
     - Compute the average of all target values (`Salary`), e.g., $\text{Base Model Output} = 75K$.
     - This average serves as the initial prediction for all records.

   - **Step 2: Compute Residuals**
     - Residuals represent the error in prediction:
       $
       \text{Residual} = y - \hat{y}
       $
       For instance:
       - $50 - 75 = -25$
       - $70 - 75 = -5$, etc.

   - **Step 3: Build a Decision Tree**
     - Train a regression decision tree using:
       - Input features (`Experience` and `Degree`).
       - Target as residuals from the previous step.

   - **Step 4: Update Predictions**
     - Combine the base model's prediction with the residuals predicted by the decision tree.
     - Introduce a **learning rate ($\alpha$)**:
       $
       \hat{y}_{\text{new}} = \hat{y}_{\text{old}} + \alpha \times \text{Tree Prediction}
       $
       Example:
       - $\hat{y}_{\text{base}} = 75$
       - Tree Prediction = -23
       - Learning Rate = 0.1
       - Updated Prediction: $75 + (0.1 \times -23) = 72.7$.

   - **Step 5: Repeat Steps for Multiple Iterations**
     - Use updated predictions to compute new residuals.
     - Train additional trees sequentially to minimize errors.

4. **Learning Rate ($\alpha$):**
   - Controls the contribution of each tree to the final model.
   - Ranges between $0$ and $1$.
   - Helps prevent overfitting by scaling the updates.

5. **Final Predictions:**
   - Combine predictions from the base model and all decision trees, scaled by the learning rate.
   - The final prediction is a cumulative sum of weighted tree predictions.

### How Gradient Boosting Works

- **Iterative Error Reduction:** Each tree attempts to correct the errors made by the previous trees.
- **Regularization with Learning Rate:** Prevents large updates, ensuring the model generalizes well.
