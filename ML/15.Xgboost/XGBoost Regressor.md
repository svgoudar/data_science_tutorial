### Explanation of XGBoost Regressor

#### Introduction

This video explains how the **XGBoost regression algorithm** works. Similar to the XGBoost classifier, this regression algorithm builds sequential decision trees, but there are slight differences in computation due to the regression problem's nature.

The example problem involves predicting a person's **salary** based on their **experience** and **career gap**. Here, salary is the dependent feature, making this a regression problem.

### Steps to Construct XGBoost Regressor

1. **Base Model Creation**
   - The base model starts by predicting the **mean** of the target variable (salary in this case).
   - For the dataset:
     $
     \text{Average Salary} = \frac{40 + 42 + 52 + 60 + 62}{5} \approx 51\, \text{k}
     $
   - The base model predicts **51 k** as the salary for any input.

2. **Residual Calculation**
   - Residuals represent the error between the actual and predicted values:
     $
     \text{Residual} = \text{Actual Value} - \text{Predicted Value (Base Model)}
     $
     Example calculations:
     - Residual for $40 - 51 = -11$
     - Residual for $42 - 51 = -9$
     - Similarly for other rows: $1, 9, 11$.

     Residuals: $[-11, -9, 1, 9, 11]$

3. **Construct the Decision Tree**
   - Using **input features (Experience and Gap)** as predictors and residuals as target values.
   - Decision tree splitting involves thresholds for continuous features, such as $\text{Experience} \leq 2$.

   Example Split:
   - **Left Node**: Residuals for $\text{Experience} \leq 2$ ($-11$)
   - **Right Node**: Residuals for $\text{Experience} > 2$ ($-9, 1, 9, 11$)

4. **Compute Similarity Weight**
   - **Similarity Weight Formula (Regression):**
     $
     \text{Similarity Weight} = \frac{\sum (\text{Residuals})^2}{n + \lambda}
     $
     - $n$: Number of residuals in the node.
     - $\lambda$: Regularization parameter to prevent overfitting.

     **Example Calculation:**
     - **Left Node**:
       $
       \text{Similarity Weight} = \frac{(-11)^2}{1 + 1} = \frac{121}{2} = 65.5
       $
     - **Right Node**:
       $
       \text{Similarity Weight} = \frac{(-9 + 1 + 9 + 11)^2}{4 + 1} = \frac{144}{5} = 28.8
       $

5. **Compute Gain**
   - Gain evaluates the effectiveness of a split:
     $
     \text{Gain} = \text{Similarity Weight (Left)} + \text{Similarity Weight (Right)} - \text{Similarity Weight (Root)}
     $
     **Example Calculation**:
     - Root Node Similarity Weight: $1.16$
     - Gain:
       $
       \text{Gain} = 65.5 + 28.8 - 1.16 = 98.34
       $

6. **Iterative Improvement**
   - After computing gain, adjust the split threshold or select a different feature to maximize gain.
   - Repeat the process to build multiple decision trees sequentially.

### Key Differences from XGBoost Classifier

- The formula for **similarity weight** and **gain** changes in regression due to the absence of probabilities.
- Residuals represent the numerical error (as opposed to classification error or log odds).

### Final Notes

- The **lambda parameter** is crucial in similarity weight computation, acting as a regularization term.
- XGBoost regression focuses on reducing residuals at each step through sequential tree construction, leading to more accurate predictions.
- By iteratively adding trees and updating residuals, the algorithm minimizes error and converges to the true values.
