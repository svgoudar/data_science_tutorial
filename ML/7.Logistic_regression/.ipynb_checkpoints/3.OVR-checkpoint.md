### Key Concept: One vs Rest (OvR)
One of the important strategies to handle multi-class classification with logistic regression is **One vs Rest (OvR)**. In this technique, we treat each class as a binary classification problem. Let's break down the process step by step.

#### Example Setup:
Suppose we have data points with features **f1, f2, f3**, and an output feature with three categories: **0, 1, 2**. The goal is to classify data into one of these categories. With OvR, we create separate binary classifiers for each class:

1. **Model 1 (M1)** will classify whether a data point belongs to **class 0** or not (binary classification: **class 0 vs. not class 0**).
2. **Model 2 (M2)** will classify whether a data point belongs to **class 1** or not (binary classification: **class 1 vs. not class 1**).
3. **Model 3 (M3)** will classify whether a data point belongs to **class 2** or not (binary classification: **class 2 vs. not class 2**).

#### Training the Models:
Each of these models will train using **binary labels**. For example:
- In **M1**, we will mark the data points with class 0 as **1** (positive class) and the rest as **0** (negative class).
- In **M2**, the data points with class 1 are marked as **1** and the rest as **0**.
- In **M3**, the data points with class 2 are marked as **1** and the rest as **0**.

Thus, each model learns to distinguish its target class from the others.

#### Prediction:
Once the models are trained, we can use them to classify new data points. For a new test data point:
1. The test point is passed through all three models (M1, M2, M3).
2. Each model outputs a probability score indicating how likely the test point belongs to its corresponding class.
   
For example:
- **M1** might output a probability of 0.25 (for class 0).
- **M2** might output a probability of 0.20 (for class 1).
- **M3** might output a probability of 0.55 (for class 2).

#### Final Classification:
We then compare the probabilities:
- The class with the highest probability is selected as the predicted class.
- In our case, **M3** has the highest probability of 0.55, so the test point is classified as **class 2**.

### One vs One (OvO) Comparison:
Another approach for multi-class classification is **One vs One (OvO)**, where you train a classifier for each pair of classes. While **OvR** focuses on distinguishing one class from all others, **OvO** focuses on distinguishing each pair of classes from each other.

In the next video, we will explore both **One vs One (OvO)** and **One vs Rest (OvR)** with practical examples to understand how they work in real-world scenarios.
