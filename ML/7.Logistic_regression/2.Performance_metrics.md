In this video, you’re covering performance metrics for classification tasks, focusing on binary classification and multi-class classification. You start with an example of logistic regression, where the goal is to classify data into two categories based on a decision boundary (a line in 2D space). You discuss performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F-beta score, which help assess the model's performance.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Confusion Matrix**:

   - The **confusion matrix** is a 2x2 matrix used for binary classification, where the rows represent actual values and the columns represent predicted values.
   - The matrix has four categories:
     - **True Positive (TP)**: The model correctly predicts the positive class (1).
     - **True Negative (TN)**: The model correctly predicts the negative class (0).
     - **False Positive (FP)**: The model incorrectly predicts positive when the true class is negative.
     - **False Negative (FN)**: The model incorrectly predicts negative when the true class is positive.

2. **Accuracy**:

   - **Accuracy** is the ratio of correct predictions to the total predictions:
     $
     \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP} + \text{FN} + \text{TN}}
     $
   - It can be misleading in imbalanced datasets where the number of one class (e.g., zeros) is much larger than the other (e.g., ones).

3. **Precision**:

   - **Precision** focuses on the **positive class** and calculates how many of the predicted positives are actually positive:
     $
     \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
     $
   - It answers the question: _Out of all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?_

4. **Recall**:

   - **Recall**, also known as **Sensitivity** or **True Positive Rate**, measures how many of the actual positives were correctly predicted:
     $
     \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
     $
   - It answers the question: _Out of all the actual positives, how many did the model correctly identify?_

5. **F-beta Score**:
   - The **F-beta score** is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. It’s used to balance the trade-off between precision and recall, particularly when one is more important than the other. The general formula is:
     $
     F_{\beta} = \left(1 + \beta^2\right) \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\beta^2 \times \text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
     $
   - In F1-score, **β=1**, balancing precision and recall equally. When **β > 1**, recall is emphasized, and when **β < 1**, precision is prioritized.

### Why Not Just Use Accuracy?

Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, as a model can predict the majority class for all instances and still achieve high accuracy, even if it fails to detect the minority class (the class you're actually interested in). In such cases, metrics like precision and recall become more useful.

### Multi-Class Classification:

For multi-class classification (e.g., more than two classes), the confusion matrix becomes larger (e.g., 3x3 for three classes, 4x4 for four classes). The same principles of precision, recall, and accuracy can be applied, but the calculations will involve the sum of the results for each class.

### Next Steps:

You can now move on to explaining how precision and recall impact model performance and how F-beta scores help in tuning models depending on the priority between precision and recall. You might also introduce the concept of the **ROC curve** and **AUC** as additional evaluation tools for classification tasks.
