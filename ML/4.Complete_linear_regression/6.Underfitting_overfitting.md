Let's start by defining the **training**, **test**, and **validation datasets**:

1. **Training Dataset**: This is the primary set of data we use to train our model. Let's say we have 1000 data points. We typically split this into **training data** (e.g., 70%) and **test data** (30%)—meaning 700 records for training and 300 for testing.
  
2. **Test Dataset**: The test dataset is used only after the model is trained to evaluate how well it performs on unseen data, helping us gauge its generalization.

3. **Validation Dataset**: Often, we further split the training data into a **train** subset and a **validation** subset. The validation set helps us **tune hyperparameters** without affecting the test data. This split allows us to optimize the model and avoid using the test set during tuning.

### Overfitting vs. Underfitting

Overfitting and underfitting describe how well a model learns from the training data and generalizes to new data:

- **Overfitting**: This occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data. For example, if a model achieves 90% accuracy on training but only 50% on testing, it’s overfitting, meaning it’s "memorized" the training data but lacks flexibility for new data. This model would have **low bias** (fits the training data well) but **high variance** (performs inconsistently on test data).

- **Underfitting**: Here, the model performs poorly on both training and test data, indicating that it hasn’t learned the underlying patterns in the training data. It’s a sign of **high bias** and **high variance**, meaning it doesn’t fit well for either data set.

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Our goal is to achieve a **generalized model** that performs consistently well on both training and test datasets—this represents **low bias** and **low variance**.

To understand this visually, imagine plotting the model as a line fitting the training data points. A well-fitted line that captures the overall trend without overreacting to specific points represents a generalized model.

Conversely:

- An overfitted model would produce a line closely following every training point but deviating significantly on new data points.
- An underfitted model would result in a line that fails to capture the overall trend, missing both training and test points.

As we proceed with practical sessions, we’ll apply these concepts using evaluation metrics like **R-squared** and **Adjusted R-squared** to further assess model fit and avoid overfitting or underfitting.

Thank you, and stay tuned for the next session, where we’ll implement these concepts in Python!
