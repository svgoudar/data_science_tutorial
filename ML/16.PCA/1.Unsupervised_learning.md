### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

#### **Supervised Machine Learning**

In our previous sessions, we explored supervised machine learning algorithms, including:  

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Trees**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **XGBoost**  
- **Gradient Boost**  
- **AdaBoost**  

These algorithms solve problems in supervised machine learning, which means:  

1. **Dataset Structure**:  
   - The dataset contains both **independent features** (e.g., \( f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4 \)) and a **dependent feature** (output or target).  
   - The dependent feature is what we aim to predict.

2. **Problem Types**:  
   - **Regression**: Predict continuous output.  
   - **Classification**: Predict categorical output.  

#### **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

Now, let’s dive into **unsupervised machine learning** and understand the key differences.  

1. **No Output Feature**:  
   - Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have a dependent feature in the dataset.  
   - Example: A dataset containing features like **age**, **years of experience**, and **salary** without any specific target variable.

2. **Goal**:  
   - The main objective is to **group data points** into **clusters** based on similarity.  

3. **Example**:  
   Consider a dataset with features such as age, years of experience, and salary. Using unsupervised algorithms, we can group individuals into clusters where each cluster contains similar data points based on these features.  

#### **Real-World Use Case: Customer Segmentation**

**Scenario**:  

- Suppose you own a product and have data on your customers, including features like **salary** and **spending score**.  
- Using unsupervised learning, you can segment customers into different groups:  
  - **Frequent Buyers**: Offer discounts to encourage first-day purchases.  
  - **Occasional Buyers**: Offer higher discounts to attract purchases.  

This segmentation helps in tailoring marketing strategies, such as offering a 15% discount to frequent buyers or a 20% discount to occasional buyers.

#### **Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms**

In this series, we’ll cover the following algorithms:  

1. **K-Means Clustering**: A foundational clustering algorithm.  
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Groups data points in a tree-like structure.  
3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**: Identifies clusters based on density.  
4. **Silhouette Scoring**: A metric to evaluate and validate clustering models.

### Upcoming Sessions

We will explore these algorithms in-depth, covering:  

- Mathematical foundations.  
- Intuition and geometric understanding.  
- Practical implementation.  

Let’s begin with the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm in the next session!
