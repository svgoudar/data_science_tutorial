### Geometric Intuition Behind PCA

1. **Objective of PCA**:
   - Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance (information) as possible.
   - Transform the dataset into new axes (principal components) that maximize variance.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - Consider two features (e.g., size of the house and number of rooms) and plot data points in 2D space.
   - The goal is to represent this 2D data in 1D without losing significant information.

3. **Simple Projection**:
   - **Approach**: Project the data directly onto one of the axes (e.g., the x-axis).
   - **Outcome**: While dimensionality is reduced, significant information (variance) from the other axis is lost.
   - **Disadvantage**: This leads to a loss of information, as the spread (variance) in the other feature is ignored.

4. **PCA Transformation**:
   - **Core Idea**: Instead of projecting onto the existing axes, PCA finds new axes (principal components) that align with the directions of maximum variance in the data.
   - **New Axes**: These are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other and are derived through a transformation called **eigendecomposition** of the covariance matrix.
     - **PC1** (Principal Component 1): The axis with the maximum variance.
     - **PC2** (Principal Component 2): The next orthogonal axis with the maximum remaining variance.
   - For more than two dimensions, additional principal components are calculated similarly.

5. **Projection onto Principal Components**:
   - Data points are projected onto the new axes (principal components).
   - **Advantage**: Maximum variance is captured along the first principal component (PC1), minimizing information loss.
   - The second principal component captures the next largest variance, and so on.

6. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - After projection, the data in higher dimensions (e.g., 2D) is reduced to a lower dimension (e.g., 1D).
   - The reduced representation retains most of the dataset's original variance, ensuring minimal information loss.

7. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Variance and Spread**: PCA ensures the retained dimensions capture the maximum spread (variance) of the data.
   - **Transformation**: New axes are calculated using **eigenvectors** (directions) and **eigenvalues** (magnitude of variance) of the covariance matrix.

8. **Advantages of PCA**:
   - Effective dimensionality reduction.
   - Retains maximum variance for improved model performance.
   - Helps eliminate correlated features by creating uncorrelated principal components.

### **Understanding PCA: Reducing Dimensions**

1. **Goal of PCA**:  
   The primary objective of PCA is **dimensionality reduction** while retaining the **maximum variance** of the data. This is achieved by identifying new axes (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized.

2. **Problem Setup**:  
   Imagine a 2D plot with points distributed across two axes, $x$ and $y$. The goal is to project these points onto a single axis (1D) while capturing as much variance as possible.

### **Key Concepts in PCA**

#### 1. **Principal Component (PC)**  

- The **principal component** is a line (or vector) onto which the data is projected.  
- This line is chosen such that it captures the **maximum variance** of the original data.

#### 2. **Projection**  

- Projection refers to mapping data points onto the principal component line.  
- Example: For a point $P_1$ with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$, its projection onto the principal component (denoted as $P_1'$) involves determining the closest point on the PC line.  
- Mathematically, projection is calculated using the **dot product**:  
     $
     P_1' = \vec{P_1} \cdot \vec{u}
     $  
     Here, $\vec{u}$ is the unit vector along the principal component line.

- Since $\vec{u}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude is $1$, simplifying the projection formula.

#### 3. **Variance and Cost Function**  

- After projecting all points ($P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$) onto the principal component line, we obtain scalar values ($P_1', P_2', \dots, P_n'$).  
- These values represent distances from the origin to each projection point along the PC.  
- The **variance** of these scalar values is computed using:  
     $
     \text{Variance} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}
     $
- The goal of PCA is to **maximize this variance** to ensure the principal component captures the spread of the data.

### **Finding the Best Principal Component**

#### 1. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**  

- To determine the optimal principal component (unit vector $\vec{u}$), PCA uses the concepts of **eigenvectors** and **eigenvalues**.
- Eigenvectors are directions (axes), and eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance captured along these directions.

#### 2. **Steps to Identify Principal Components**  

- **Step 1**: Compute the **covariance matrix** of the data features.  
     The covariance matrix summarizes relationships (variance and covariance) between all pairs of features.  
- **Step 2**: Solve the **eigenvalue equation**:  
     $
     A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
     $
     Here:
  - $A$ is the covariance matrix.
  - $\vec{v}$ is an eigenvector.
  - $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue associated with $\vec{v}$.  

- **Step 3**: Select the eigenvector corresponding to the **largest eigenvalue**.  
  - The largest eigenvalue indicates the direction of maximum variance.

---

### **Why Use Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues?**  

- Exploring all possible directions to find the one with maximum variance is computationally expensive.  
- Eigen-decomposition simplifies this process by systematically identifying the direction (eigenvector) that captures the most variance, eliminating the need for trial and error.

---

### **Summary**

1. PCA reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining maximum variance.
2. The process involves two key steps:
   - **Projection**: Project data points onto a candidate axis (unit vector).
   - **Cost Function**: Measure the variance of the projected points to evaluate the axis.
3. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues provide a mathematical solution to find the best axis efficiently.
   - The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is the **first principal component**.

### **Understanding Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**  

In this video, we will explore **eigenvectors and eigenvalues** and their role in data analysis, particularly in finding the **principal components** that capture the maximum variance in a dataset.  

#### **Why Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues?**  

Eigenvectors and eigenvalues help us identify the directions (principal components) along which data varies the most. Letâ€™s say we have a set of data points, and our goal is to find the best principal component line. This line will allow us to project the data and retain the maximum variance.  

#### **Linear Transformation and Eigenvalues**  

Imagine a matrix $A$ representing a linear transformation and a vector $v$. When we apply the transformation $A$ to $v$, the result is a scaled version of $v$:  

$
A \cdot v = \lambda \cdot v
$  

Here, $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue, and $v$ is the eigenvector. The eigenvector's direction remains unchanged, but it is scaled by the eigenvalue $\lambda$.  

#### **Example of Linear Transformation**  

Consider a vector $v = [1, 1]$ and a transformation matrix $A$. When we apply $A$, the vector changes direction and magnitude. For instance:  

$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 2 \\
1 & 3
\end{bmatrix},
\quad v =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$

After applying $A$, the vector $v$ transforms to $[4, 2]$, with an eigenvalue $\lambda = 4$. Repeating this process with various vectors and transformations shows that the eigenvector with the **largest eigenvalue** corresponds to the principal component capturing the maximum variance.  

#### **Eigen Decomposition of Covariance Matrix**  

To calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues:  

1. **Compute the Covariance Matrix**  
   For features $X$ and $Y$, the covariance matrix is:  

   $
   \text{Cov}(X, Y) =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \text{Var}(X) & \text{Cov}(X, Y) \\
   \text{Cov}(Y, X) & \text{Var}(Y)
   \end{bmatrix}
   $

   - Variance terms ($\text{Var}(X)$, $\text{Var}(Y)$) occupy the diagonal.  
   - Covariance terms ($\text{Cov}(X, Y)$, $\text{Cov}(Y, X)$) occupy the off-diagonal and are symmetric.  

   For $n$ features, the covariance matrix becomes $n \times n$.  

2. **Eigen Decomposition**  
   Perform eigen decomposition on the covariance matrix $A$:  

   $
   A \cdot v = \lambda \cdot v
   $  

   This yields eigenvalues ($\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n$) and corresponding eigenvectors.  

#### **Principal Components**  

- The eigenvector with the **largest eigenvalue** (maximum magnitude) represents the first principal component (PC1).  
- Subsequent eigenvectors correspond to PC2, PC3, and so on, in descending order of variance explained.  

By projecting data onto these principal components, we reduce dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible.

### **Steps to Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**  

1. **Compute the Covariance Matrix**  
   For features $X$ and $Y$, calculate variance and covariance terms using:  

   $
   \text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{n - 1}
   $  

2. **Perform Eigen Decomposition**  
   Solve the equation $A \cdot v = \lambda \cdot v$ to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  

3. **Identify Principal Components**  
   - Eigenvectors indicate the directions of maximum variance.  
   - Eigenvalues quantify the magnitude of variance along each eigenvector.
