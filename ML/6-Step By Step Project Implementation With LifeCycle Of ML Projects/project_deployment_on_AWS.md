### **1. Understand Elastic Beanstalk**
- Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
- It's essentially a managed service where you can set up an environment to run applications, complete with servers, scaling, and monitoring.

---

### **2. Prepare Your Codebase**
- **Create Configuration for Elastic Beanstalk**:
  - Add a folder named `.ebextensions` in your project directory.
  - Inside `.ebextensions`, create a `python.config` file with configurations for running a Python-based application on Beanstalk. Example content:
    ```yaml
    container_commands:
      aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
        WSGIPath: application:application
    ```
  - Ensure your main Python application file is named `application.py`, with a callable object `application`.

---

### **3. Push Code to GitHub**
- Stage, commit, and push the codebase changes (including the `.ebextensions` folder) to your GitHub repository:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Beanstalk configuration"
  git push origin main
  ```

---

### **4. Deploy with Elastic Beanstalk**
- **Set Up Elastic Beanstalk Application**:
  1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console → **Elastic Beanstalk**.
  2. Create a new application (e.g., "Test Forest Fire").
  3. Choose **Python** as the platform (e.g., Python 3.8).
  4. Create an environment for the application.
  5. You can either upload the application code directly or link the environment to a repository via a pipeline.

---

### **5. Create an AWS CodePipeline**
- AWS CodePipeline automates the deployment process, connecting the GitHub repository to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
  
  **Steps to Set Up CodePipeline**:
  1. Go to the AWS Management Console → **CodePipeline**.
  2. Create a new pipeline (e.g., "Test Forest Fire Pipeline").
  3. Choose the source provider as **GitHub**.
  4. Authenticate GitHub and select the repository and branch (e.g., `main`).
  5. Enable **GitHub Webhooks** to trigger deployments automatically upon code changes.
  6. Skip the build stage if no build process is required.
  7. Configure the deployment to push code to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

---

### **6. Test and Monitor Deployment**
- Once configured, Elastic Beanstalk will create and provision the environment, which might take a few minutes.
- CodePipeline ensures that changes made in the GitHub repository are automatically deployed to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Elastic Beanstalk simplifies deploying and managing applications without dealing with underlying infrastructure.
- CodePipeline automates the integration between GitHub and Elastic Beanstalk for continuous delivery.
- Configurations like `.ebextensions` and `python.config` are critical for Elastic Beanstalk to correctly identify and execute your application.
