### Ridge Regression Overview

**Ridge Regression** is a technique used to handle the problem of **overfitting** in linear regression by introducing a penalty term in the cost function. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the training data too perfectly, thereby improving its generalization on unseen test data.

### Revisiting Linear Regression Cost Function
The cost function for linear regression is:  
$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)^2
$  
where:
- $ h_\theta(x^{(i)}) $: predicted value
- $ y^{(i)} $: actual value
- $ m $: number of training examples  

This cost function measures the **mean squared error (MSE)**. If the model overfits the data (e.g., achieves nearly 100% accuracy on training data), the test data error will likely increase, indicating poor generalization.

### Ridge Regression: L2 Regularization
In Ridge Regression, a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's coefficients ($\theta$) is added to the cost function. The modified cost function becomes:  

$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2
$

Here:
1. $ \lambda $: **Regularization parameter** (hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty).
2. $ \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2 $: Sum of squares of the coefficients (excluding $\theta_0$).

#### Why Add Regularization?
- The penalty term discourages large coefficient values, thereby reducing model complexity.
- Helps in scenarios where overfitting occurs due to collinearity or noise in the data.

### Effect of Ridge Regression
- **Overfitting Reduction**: By adding $\lambda$, the model avoids learning a perfect fit for the training data.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:  
  - **Low $\lambda$**: Model behaves like linear regression, with a higher risk of overfitting.
  - **High $\lambda$**: Adds stronger penalties, simplifying the model but potentially underfitting.

### Impact of $\lambda$ on Cost Function
- **When $\lambda = 0$**: Ridge regression reduces to standard linear regression.
- **When $\lambda > 0$**: Global minima shift, reducing coefficients $\theta_j$.
- Increasing $\lambda$ pushes the model to reduce the magnitude of $\theta_j$, effectively "shrinking" the coefficients.

### Visualizing the Effect
In a graph of cost function $J(\theta)$ vs. $\theta$:
- **$\lambda = 0$**: The global minima is at the original point of linear regression.
- **$\lambda > 0$**: The minima shifts, with $\theta_j$ decreasing in magnitude.
- As $\lambda$ increases, the model prioritizes simplicity, and coefficients $\theta_j$ shrink further.

### Key Takeaways
1. **Ridge Regression** adds a penalty to prevent overfitting by controlling the magnitude of coefficients.
2. **$\lambda$** is a hyperparameter, tuned to balance bias and variance.
3. **When $\lambda$ increases**, slope values ($\theta_j$) decrease, avoiding overly complex models.
4. It is most useful when dealing with multicollinearity or noisy datasets.
