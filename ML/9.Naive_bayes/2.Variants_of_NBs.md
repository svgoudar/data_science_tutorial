# Naive Bayes Variants: Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Gaussian

Hello everyone,  

In this video, we’ll continue our discussion on the Naive Bayes algorithm, diving into its three key variants:  

1. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**  
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**  
3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**  

Each of these variants caters to specific types of datasets and use cases, making it essential to understand which one to use based on your data.

### 1. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**  

This variant is used when your **features** follow a **Bernoulli distribution**, meaning each feature represents a binary outcome:  

- **Examples of binary outcomes**:  
  - Success/Failure  
  - Yes/No  
  - Male/Female  
  - Pass/Fail  

#### Key Characteristics  

- Each feature value is either **0** or **1**.  
- It is well-suited for binary datasets like document classification tasks where words are present or absent.  

#### Example  

| Feature 1 (F1) | Feature 2 (F2) | Feature 3 (F3) | Output  |  
|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|  
| Yes            | Pass           | Male           | 1 (Pass)|  
| No             | Fail           | Female         | 0 (Fail)|  

Whenever your dataset has such binary features, **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** is an ideal choice.

### 2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**  

This variant is designed for **text classification problems** where the features represent frequencies or counts of words, such as:  

- **Spam detection** (Spam vs. Not Spam)  
- **Document categorization**  

#### Process  

1. Convert text into numerical representations using techniques like:  
   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**  
   - **TF-IDF**  
   - **Word2Vec**  

2. Use the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm to process these numerical features.  

#### Example  

- Input:  
  - Email 1: “You have won a $1M lottery.”  
    - Output: **Spam**  
  - Email 2: “Good job on your project, Krish.”  
    - Output: **Ham** (Not Spam)  

Multinomial Naive Bayes is highly effective for **discrete feature sets** derived from textual data.

### 3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**  

Gaussian Naive Bayes is used when the **features are continuous** and follow a **Gaussian (normal) distribution**.  

#### Key Characteristics  

- Assumes features follow a bell-shaped curve.  
- Used for datasets with **continuous variables**, such as age, height, or weight.  

#### Example  

Consider the **Iris dataset**:  

- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width (all continuous).  
- Task: Classify flowers into Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor, or Iris-Virginica.  

For such problems, Gaussian Naive Bayes is a natural fit because the continuous variables often follow a Gaussian distribution.

### Choosing the Right Variant  

1. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Use for binary feature datasets.  
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Use for text or frequency-based data.  
3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Use for continuous features, especially when they approximate a Gaussian distribution.  

If your dataset contains mixed feature types, you might need to preprocess or transform the features to make them suitable for a specific variant.
