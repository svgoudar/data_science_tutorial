Hello everyone! In this video, we’ll discuss a very important topic: **Pre-pruning** and **Post-pruning** in Decision Trees.

To begin, let’s understand the meaning of pruning. If you think of a gardener trimming plants to maintain their shape and promote healthy growth, pruning in decision trees works similarly. It helps improve the tree’s performance by avoiding unnecessary complexity.

### Problem Statement

Suppose we have a training dataset and use a decision tree algorithm with its default parameters. The tree will keep splitting the data until it reaches the leaf nodes, ensuring all splits are pure.

For instance:

- At one point, the split might result in a leaf node with 9 "Yes" and 2 "No" categories. However, the algorithm may continue splitting further, creating nodes like:
  - 9 "Yes" and 0 "No"
  - 0 "Yes" and 2 "No"

While these splits are pure, they are unnecessary and lead to a common problem: **overfitting**.

### Overfitting in Decision Trees

Overfitting occurs when a decision tree learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant details. This results in:

1. **High training accuracy** but
2. **Low test accuracy**, making the model less generalizable.

Overfitting can be characterized as:

- **Low Bias** (good fit for training data)
- **High Variance** (poor performance on test data)

To address this issue, we use **pruning techniques**:

- **Post-pruning**
- **Pre-pruning**

### Post-pruning

**Definition:** In post-pruning, we first construct the complete decision tree and then prune it by removing unnecessary branches.

#### Example

- If a split results in 9 "Yes" and 2 "No" categories, the tree can stop further splitting and make the output "Yes" directly. This avoids creating additional pure splits, saving computation and reducing overfitting.

#### Steps

1. **Construct the complete decision tree**
2. **Prune the tree** by cutting branches based on certain criteria, such as depth or impurity thresholds.

#### Advantages

- Suitable for **smaller datasets**, as building the entire tree for large datasets can be computationally expensive.

---

### Pre-pruning

**Definition:** In pre-pruning, we prevent the tree from growing excessively by setting constraints during its construction. This involves tuning hyperparameters to limit the tree’s depth and complexity.

#### Hyperparameters to Tune

- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of the tree.
- **max_features**: Maximum number of features to consider for a split.
- **min_samples_split**: Minimum samples required to split a node.
- **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum samples required to be at a leaf node.
- **criterion**: The function to measure split quality (e.g., Gini, entropy).

#### How to Perform Pre-pruning

1. Use hyperparameter tuning techniques like **GridSearchCV** to find the optimal values for these parameters.
2. Set these parameters before constructing the tree.

#### Advantages

- More efficient for **large datasets**, as it avoids constructing the full tree.
- Reduces time complexity by controlling tree growth during construction.

| **Approach**        | Remove unnecessary branches post hoc        | Limit tree growth via hyperparameters       |

### Practical Demonstration

Let’s quickly explore the relevant hyperparameters in the **scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier** documentation:

1. **criterion**: Options include Gini, entropy, and log loss.
2. **splitter**: Defines the strategy for choosing the split at each node (e.g., best or random).
3. **max_depth**: Limits the depth of the tree.
4. **min_samples_split**: Minimum samples required to split a node.
5. **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum samples required at a leaf node.
6. **max_features**: Number of features to consider for a split.

These parameters allow fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance while avoiding overfitting.

### Summary

To reduce overfitting in decision trees, we can:

1. Use **Post-pruning**: Construct the full tree and prune it afterward (best for small datasets).
2. Use **Pre-pruning**: Limit tree growth during construction through hyperparameter tuning (best for large datasets).

In the practical part of this session, we’ll demonstrate how these concepts work with a real dataset. Stay tuned!
