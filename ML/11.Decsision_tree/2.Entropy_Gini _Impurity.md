Great, here's a summary for continuing the discussion on **purity in decision tree classifiers** with a focus on **Entropy** and **Gini Impurity**:

### **Purity in Decision Tree Classifiers**

#### **1. Understanding Entropy**

$
  H(S) = - \sum P_i \log_2 P_i
$

- $P_+$: Probability of a positive class (e.g., "Yes").
- $P_-$: Probability of a negative class (e.g., "No").
- For multi-class problems, $P_i$ refers to the probability of each class.

- **Key Insights:**
  - Entropy measures the randomness or impurity in a split.
  - For **binary classification**:
    - If $P_+ = P_- = 0.5$, entropy is maximum ($H = 1$), indicating the most impure split.
    - If $P_+$ or $P_-$ is $1$, entropy is $0$, indicating a pure split.
  - **Example Calculation:**
    - For $C_1$ with 3 "Yes" and 3 "No":
     $
      H(C_1) = - \left(\frac{3}{6} \log_2 \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6} \log_2 \frac{3}{6}\right) = 1
     $
    - For $C_2$ with 3 "Yes" and 0 "No":
     $
      H(C_2) = - \left(\frac{3}{3} \log_2 \frac{3}{3} + 0 \cdot \log_2 0\right) = 0
     $

- **Graph:**
  - The graph of entropy is a symmetric curve.
  - $H(S)$ ranges between 0 (pure split) and 1 (most impure split).
  - When $P_+ = P_- = 0.5$, entropy is at its peak.

#### **2. Understanding Gini Impurity**

- **Formula:**
 $
  G(S) = 1 - \sum P_i^2
 $
  - $P_+$: Probability of a positive class.
  - $P_-$: Probability of a negative class.
  - For multi-class problems, sum over all class probabilities squared.

- **Key Insights:**
  - Gini impurity measures the probability of misclassification.
  - For **binary classification**:
    - If $P_+ = P_- = 0.5$, Gini impurity is maximum ($G = 0.5$), indicating the most impure split.
    - If $P_+$ or $P_-$ is $1$, Gini impurity is $0$, indicating a pure split.
  - **Example Calculation:**
    - For $C_1$ with 3 "Yes" and 3 "No":
     $
      G(C_1) = 1 - \left(\left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^2\right) = 0.5
     $
    - For $C_2$ with 3 "Yes" and 0 "No":
     $
      G(C_2) = 1 - \left(\left(\frac{3}{3}\right)^2 + 0^2\right) = 0
     $

- **Graph:**
  - The graph of Gini impurity is also symmetric.
  - $G(S)$ ranges between 0 (pure split) and 0.5 (most impure split).

#### **3. Differences Between Entropy and Gini Impurity**

| **Metric**         | **Entropy**                 | **Gini Impurity**           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Range**          | [0, 1]                     | [0, 0.5]                   |
| **Computational Cost** | Higher (due to logarithms) | Lower (only squares)        |
| **Implication**    | Focuses on information gain (logarithmic relationship). | Focuses on class separability. |
