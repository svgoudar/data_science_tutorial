### **Decision Tree Split for Numerical Features**

When working with decision trees and numerical features, the splitting process differs from that of categorical features. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how the split is handled:

---

### **1. Sorting Feature Values**

The first step is to **sort the feature values** in ascending order. For example, if the feature values are `[3.6, 2.3, 5.1, 4.0]`, they are sorted to `[2.3, 3.6, 4.0, 5.1]`. Sorting helps in efficiently identifying potential thresholds for splits.

---

### **2. Generating Thresholds**

For a numerical feature, the splits occur at the **midpoints** between consecutive values. For the sorted list `[2.3, 3.6, 4.0, 5.1]`, potential thresholds are:

- $2.95$ (midpoint between 2.3 and 3.6),
- $3.8$ (midpoint between 3.6 and 4.0),
- $4.55$ (midpoint between 4.0 and 5.1).

Each threshold creates two splits:

- **Left node:** Values ≤ threshold,
- **Right node:** Values > threshold.

### **3. Splitting the Data**

At each threshold:

1. Separate the dataset into two groups based on the threshold.
2. For each group, calculate the number of positive and negative class instances.

---

### **4. Evaluating the Splits**

The quality of each split is measured using **Information Gain (IG)**, which compares the impurity of the parent node to the weighted impurity of the child nodes.

- **Impurity measures**: Entropy or Gini Impurity.
- The formula for IG:
  $
  IG = I(parent) - \left( \frac{|left|}{|parent|} \cdot I(left) + \frac{|right|}{|parent|} \cdot I(right) \right)
  $
  Where $I$ represents the impurity measure.

The split with the **highest Information Gain** is selected.

---

### **5. Iterating Over Thresholds**

For all possible thresholds, decision trees evaluate the splits and compute their respective Information Gain. This process is computationally intensive, especially for large datasets.

---

### **Disadvantage**

- **Time Complexity**: Sorting and evaluating thresholds for millions of records increases the computational cost.
- However, modern implementations of decision trees (like those in scikit-learn) optimize this process to minimize computation time.

---

### **Summary**

1. Numerical feature values are sorted.
2. Thresholds are identified between consecutive values.
3. Data is split at each threshold, and Information Gain is computed.
4. The threshold with the highest Information Gain is chosen for the split.

Despite its computational expense, this technique ensures effective splits in decision trees for numerical features.
