### Video Outline: Understanding Multiple Linear Regression

**Introduction**  

- Welcome back! In our previous video, we explored the convergence algorithm for simple linear regression. Today, we'll be discussing **multiple linear regression** and understanding its key differences from simple linear regression.

**Recap of Simple Linear Regression**  

- In simple linear regression, we used **one input (independent) feature** to predict an output.  
- Example: Predicting **height** based on **weight**.
  - Equation of the best fit line:  
    $h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$
  - Here:
    - $x$ is the input feature (weight).
    - $\theta_0$ is the intercept.
    - $\theta_1$ is the slope (coefficient).
- We updated $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ to minimize our cost function using **gradient descent**.

**Transition to Multiple Linear Regression**  

- But what if we have **more than one input feature**?
- Let's consider a new example: **House Price Prediction**.
  - Features of the dataset:
    - **Number of rooms**
    - **Size of the house**
    - **Location**
    - **Price** (target variable)
- Here, we have multiple independent features:
  - $x_1$ = Number of rooms
  - $x_2$ = Size of the house
  - $x_3$ = Location
  - **Price** is our dependent (output) variable.

**Equation of Multiple Linear Regression**  

- With multiple input features, the equation extends to:
  $h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_3$
  - $\theta_0$ is still the intercept.
  - $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3$ are coefficients (slopes) for each input feature.
- As the number of features increases, the number of coefficients also increases. However, there will always be **one intercept**.

**Visualizing Gradient Descent for Multiple Features**  

- In simple linear regression, we visualize gradient descent in **2D** (with $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$).
- In multiple linear regression, we move to **higher dimensions**:
  - For 2 features: **3D surface plot** with $\theta_0, \theta_1, \theta_2$.
  - For 3+ features: Think of it as a **multi-dimensional space**.
- Gradient descent aims to minimize the **cost function $J(\theta)$** by adjusting all coefficients until convergence.
  - $J(\theta)$ represents the **error** between predicted and actual values.
  - Our goal is to reach the **global minimum** in this multi-dimensional space.

**Key Takeaways**  

- **Simple Linear Regression**:
  - 1 independent feature.
  - Equation: $h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**:
  - 2 or more independent features.
  - Equation: $h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_n x_n$.
- **Practical applications** of multiple linear regression:
  - Predicting house prices, stock prices, sales forecasting, etc.
