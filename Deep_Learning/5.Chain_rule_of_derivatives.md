The chain rule of derivatives is a foundational concept in deep learning and calculus, critical for training neural networks through backpropagation. Here's a structured overview of the key topics discussed:

### **1. Chain Rule of Derivatives:**

The chain rule allows the computation of derivatives for composite functions. It is expressed mathematically as:

$
\frac{dL}{dx} = \frac{dL}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$

In deep learning, the loss $L$ depends on multiple intermediate variables, each dependent on preceding variables, creating a chain of dependencies.

### **2. Application in Neural Networks:**

#### **Forward Propagation:**

- Inputs pass through layers of neurons.
- Weights ($W$) and biases ($b$) are applied, followed by activation functions, producing outputs at each layer.
- The final output generates a loss value based on the difference between predicted and actual outcomes.

#### **Backward Propagation (Weight Updates):**

The goal is to update the weights to minimize the loss using the gradient descent algorithm:

$
W_{\text{new}} = W_{\text{old}} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{\text{old}}}
$

Here:

- $\eta$ = learning rate.
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{\text{old}}}$ is computed using the chain rule.

### **3. Step-by-Step Expansion Using Chain Rule:**

To update a weight $W_4$ in a simple neural network:

1. **Compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_4}$:**
   - Loss ($L$) depends on the output ($O_2$).
   - $O_2$ depends on $W_4$.

Using the chain rule:
$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_4} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial O_2} \cdot \frac{\partial O_2}{\partial W_4}
$

---

#### **For Earlier Weights (e.g., $W_1$):**

The chain is longer due to dependencies across layers:
$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial O_2} \cdot \frac{\partial O_2}{\partial O_1} \cdot \frac{\partial O_1}{\partial W_1}
$

This accounts for how:

- $L$ depends on $O_2$,
- $O_2$ depends on $O_1$,
- $O_1$ depends on $W_1$.

---

### **4. Generalization to Multi-Layer Networks:**

In deeper networks:

- Each weight's gradient involves terms from all dependent layers.
- For $W_1$ in a network with two hidden layers, dependencies propagate backward through each layer, expanding the chain rule iteratively.

---

### **5. Practical Implementation:**

The chain rule's gradients are used in:

- **Gradient Descent:** Adjusting weights to minimize loss.
- **Optimizers:** Advanced methods like Adam or RMSProp build on this foundation for efficient training.

---

### **6. Assignments:**

1. **Update $W_2$ and $W_3$:** Expand the derivatives for these weights using the chain rule.
2. **Multi-Layer Example:** Compute the gradient for $W_1$ in a network with two hidden layers.

Understanding the chain rule's role in weight updates is crucial for mastering backpropagation and improving neural network performance.
