### Overview of Backpropagation and Weight Updates in Neural Networks

Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in deep learning, enabling neural networks to learn by iteratively adjusting their weights to minimize a loss function. Below is an explanation of the core topics covered:

---

### 1. **Structure of the Neural Network**

- **Input Layer**: Consists of independent features, e.g., IQ, study hours, play hours.
- **Hidden Layer**: Contains neurons connected to the input layer. Each connection has an associated weight and bias.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the dependent feature (e.g., 0 or 1 for binary classification).
- The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the problem type (binary/multi-class classification).

---

### 2. **Forward Propagation**

- Inputs are multiplied by weights, and biases are added.
- Matrix multiplication is used to compute activations in the hidden and output layers.
- Activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) are applied to introduce non-linearity.
- The output is the prediction for a given input.

---

### 3. **Loss Function**

- Measures the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.
- Examples:
  - **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Huber Loss.
  - **Classification**: Binary Cross-Entropy, Categorical Cross-Entropy.
- The goal is to minimize this loss function.

### 4. **Backpropagation**

- **Purpose**: To update the weights such that the loss function is minimized.
- **Steps**:
  1. Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight (partial derivative).
  2. Use the chain rule to propagate errors backward through the network.

### 5. **Weight Update Formula**

The weights are updated using the gradient descent algorithm:

$
w_{\text{new}} = w_{\text{old}} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{\text{old}}}
$

Where:

- $w_{\text{new}}$: Updated weight.
- $w_{\text{old}}$: Previous weight.
- $\eta$: Learning rate (controls step size for updates).
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{\text{old}}}$: Gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight.

---

### 6. **Gradient Descent**

- **Objective**: To reach the global minimum of the loss function.
- The slope (gradient) indicates the direction to adjust weights:
  - Positive slope: Decrease weights.
  - Negative slope: Increase weights.
- **Global Minima**: Point where the gradient is zero, indicating optimal weights.
- Different optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam) modify gradient descent for better performance.

---

### 7. **Learning Rate**

- Controls the magnitude of weight updates.
- Small $\eta$: Slower convergence, but more stable.
- Large $\eta$: Faster convergence but risk of overshooting.

---

### 8. **Importance of Backpropagation**

- Iteratively reduces the loss function by fine-tuning weights.
- Allows deep networks to learn complex patterns in data.
- Essential for solving both regression and classification problems.

By combining forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and weight updates, neural networks iteratively improve their predictions to achieve better performance on the given task.
